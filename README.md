# ESP8266-DHT22
Wifi temperature and humidity sensor with a web server and a ThingSpeak logging.

A simple wireless sensor based on the NodeMCU firmware.

The GPIO0 is used to the DHT22 sensor with a 4.7KOhm pullup resistor.

Compile the "main.lua" and the "dht22.lua" files because of the memory limit of the ESP8266 module.
