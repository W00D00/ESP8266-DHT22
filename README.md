# ESP8266-DHT22
A simple wifi sensor based on the NodeMCU firmware with a temperature and a humidity sensor and a web server plus ThingSpeak logging.

The GPIO0 of the ESP8266 is used to the DHT22 sensor with a 4.7 KOhm pullup resistor.

Need to compile the "main.lua" and the "dht22.lua" files because of the memory limit of the ESP8266 module.
